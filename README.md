# About Me

I am Lucas Bandeira, a software developer passionate about technology, particularly fascinated by the power of Spring Boot to build robust and efficient web applications.
My journey as a developer began with my undergraduate degree in Systems Analysis and Development, where I delved into learning Java, building a solid foundation in its fundamentals and exploring frameworks like Spring Boot. During my studies, I also had the opportunity to develop simple applications using AWS, which allowed me to explore cloud infrastructure and understand how it can be used to build scalable systems.
Currently, I am dedicated to enhancing my Java knowledge, exploring the language in its entirety, from fundamentals to frameworks like Spring Boot. Through courses and personal projects, I am always searching for new ways to apply my Java skills to create innovative and effective solutions.
I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. Connect with me!
